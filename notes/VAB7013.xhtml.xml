                        statement of our convictions does not imply any spirit of persecution on our
                        part against those who believe in the absurdities of the different
                        religions. Persecution is essential to authority and religion, and fatal to
                        freedom; we should destroy the basis of our own hopes and ideals, if we were
                        ever carried away by the spirit of persecution, bigotry and intolerance,
                        which is so commonly raised against us.</note>
