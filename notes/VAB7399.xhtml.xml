      <hi id="idp513744" style="vertical-align: super;">1</hi> Noteworthy,
                        in no small degree, is this word <quote id="idp514448" style="font-style: italic;">"Angel"</quote> here used by Macduff. Who but
                        Shakespeare would not have written <quote id="idp515216" style="font-style: italic;">"Devil"?</quote> But what a tremendous vision
                        of terrible splendour the word evokes! What a visible presence of gloomy glory—even as of the
                        great prince of pride, ambition, and rebellion—seems to rise in lurid majesty, and overshadow
                        the figure of the baffled votary of evil!</note>

      <hi id="idp961312" style="vertical-align: super;">1</hi> [These few notes were addressed as mere
                        suggestions to a gentleman studying the part of Romeo, who did me the honour to consult me upon
                        his rendering of the part. They are neither an analysis of the play nor of the character, but
                        mere hints for acting.—F. A. K.]</note>
